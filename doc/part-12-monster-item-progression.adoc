== Random choices

Now that the player character can become stronger, the challenges that
await should become harder too! It sure would be nice if the type and
quantity of monsters would vary with the dungeon level, as well as the
items. This discovery is a great way to entice the player to go
forward, wondering if around the next corner is something he or she
has never seen before!

Before going further though, let's have a look at how we're deciding
which item to place on the map:

[source]
----
let dice = rand::random::<f32>();
let mut item = if dice < 0.7 {
    // create a healing potion (70% chance)
    ...
} else if dice < 0.7 + 0.1 {
    // create a lightning bolt scroll (10% chance)
    ...
} else if dice < 0.7 + 0.1 + 0.1 {
    // create a fireball scroll (10% chance)
    ...
} else {
    // create a confuse scroll (10% chance)
    ...
};
----

As we add more items, this will be harder to maintain. Every time we
add an item, we'll have to change the probabilities in all these `if`
checks.

It would be much nicer if we could define a _loot table_. Luckily, the
`rand` crate supports this using the `WeightedChoice` distribution:

https://docs.rs/rand/~0/rand/distributions/index.html

First, we specify the random table as an array of `WeightedChoice`
structs:

[source]
----
// monster random table
let monster_chances = &mut [
    Weighted {
        weight: 80,
        item: "orc",
    },
    Weighted {
        weight: 20,
        item: "troll",
    },
];
let monster_choice = WeightedChoice::new(monster_chances);
----

(put this in `place_objects`)

We can now call `monster_choice.ind_sample(&mut rand::thread_rng())`
and it will return "orc" 80% of the time and "troll" the rest.

The numbers in `Weighted.weight` aren't percentages, though. We could
have just as easily said `8` for `orc` and `2` for `troll` or even `4`
and `1`. The number just means chances relative to each other so you
can use whichever ratio you fancy.

Anyway, as usual we need to import the new types and we need to bring
the `IndependentSample` trait into scope as well:

[source]
----
tag::use_rand_types[]
use rand::distributions::{IndependentSample, Weighted, WeightedChoice};
end::use_rand_types[]
----

And now let's fix the monster random generation from a bunch of ifs to
a neat `match` block:

[source]
----
tag::generate_monster_orc_branch[]
let mut monster = match monster_choice.ind_sample(&mut rand::thread_rng()) {
    "orc" => {
        // create an orc
end::generate_monster_orc_branch[]
        ...
tag::generate_monster_troll_branch[]
    }
    "troll" => {
        // create a troll
end::generate_monster_troll_branch[]
        ...
tag::generate_monster_else_branch[]
    }
    _ => unreachable!(),
};
end::generate_monster_else_branch[]
----

The `"orc"` and `"troll"` blocks will contain the same code as the
`if/else` blocks before.

The `_ => unreachable!()` unreachable branch is there because in Rust,
all `match` statements must be exhaustive -- they must cover all the
possibilities. Since we're matching on a string here, we need to
handle the case when the string is neither "orc" nor "troll".

We know that can't happen because we've only specified those two
possibilities in `monster_chances`, but Rust can't figure that out.

If you want to avoid this issue, you can define an enum for each
monster type like we do with `ItemType` for items. Then we'd match on
that enum instead of a string.

So let's do items next to show that off! Again, we define the
`item_chances` table:

[source]
----
// item random table
let item_chances = &mut [
    Weighted {
        weight: 70,
        item: Item::Heal,
    },
    Weighted {
        weight: 10,
        item: Item::Lightning,
    },
    Weighted {
        weight: 10,
        item: Item::Fireball,
    },
    Weighted {
        weight:10,
        item: Item::Confuse,
    },
];
let item_choice = WeightedChoice::new(item_chances);
----

And again, update the `if/else` block to match on the item type
instead:

[source]
----
tag::place_items_table[]
let mut item = match item_choice.ind_sample(&mut rand::thread_rng()) {
    Item::Heal => {
        // create a healing potion
        let mut object = Object::new(x, y, '!', "healing potion", VIOLET, false);
        object.item = Some(Item::Heal);
        object
    }
    Item::Lightning => {
        // create a lightning bolt scroll
        let mut object =
            Object::new(x, y, '#', "scroll of lightning bolt", LIGHT_YELLOW, false);
        object.item = Some(Item::Lightning);
        object
    }
    Item::Fireball => {
        // create a fireball scroll
        let mut object =
            Object::new(x, y, '#', "scroll of fireball", LIGHT_YELLOW, false);
        object.item = Some(Item::Fireball);
        object
    }
    Item::Confuse => {
        // create a confuse scroll
        let mut object =
            Object::new(x, y, '#', "scroll of confusion", LIGHT_YELLOW, false);
        object.item = Some(Item::Confuse);
        object
    }
end::place_items_table[]
};
----

As you can see, we don't have to add a catch-all branch for items, because we
handle all the variants of `Item`.


A nice benefit of these choice tables is that we're keeping the logic
for random chances separate from the one that actually generates the
objects.

So you can keep your random tables in a separate file that can be
easily moddable, generate or modify it based on game options (e.g.
difficulty), etc. without ever having to touch the object creation
code.


== Monster and item progression

The only thing left is varying the contents of the dungeon (number of
monsters and items, and their chances) according to the dungeon level.
Instead of having fixed values, they could change with some formula,
like the one we used to calculate how much xp is needed to level up.
You're welcome to do this if you prefer; however in this section we
will go down a slightly different path!

What we'd like to be able to say is that the maximum number of items
per room starts as 1 at level 1, and changes to 2 at level 4. We'll
create a table of transition points. Each entry in the table says what
the value changes to, and at what level. This should be easier to
tune, since you can change the value of one level without affecting
the values of the others!

We can take a similar approach to the weighted randomness. Let's make
a struct that defines the level and value:

[source]
----
tag::transition_struct[]
struct Transition {
    level: u32,
    value: u32,
}
end::transition_struct[]
----

Then we can define a list of these transition points and have a
function that picks the right value for the given level. For the
example above, we would define: `[Transition{level: 1, value: 1},
Transition{level: 4, value: 2}]`.

To get the correct value for a given level, we'll use this simple
function:

[source]
----
tag::from_dungeon_level_fn[]
/// Returns a value that depends on level. the table specifies what
/// value occurs after each level, default is 0.
fn from_dungeon_level(table: &[Transition], level: u32) -> u32 {
    table
        .iter()
        .rev()
        .find(|transition| level >= transition.level)
        .map_or(0, |transition| transition.value)
}
end::from_dungeon_level_fn[]
----

It takes a list of transitions, goes through them in reverse order
(using the `rev` iterator method) and as soon as it finds a transition
that's of the same or lower level, returns its `value`.

Note that for this to work, the table must be sorted by the levels. We
could do the sort explicitly as part of the `from_dungeon_level`
function.



And now we have the tools needed to make the level progression more
interesting! Let's change the number of monsters and items and their
chances. In `place_objects`:

[source]
----
tag::monster_tables[]
// maximum number of monsters per room
let max_monsters = from_dungeon_level(
    &[
        Transition { level: 1, value: 2 },
        Transition { level: 4, value: 3 },
        Transition { level: 6, value: 5 },
    ],
    level,
);

// choose random number of monsters
let num_monsters = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(0, max_monsters + 1);

// monster random table
let troll_chance = from_dungeon_level(
    &[
        Transition {
            level: 3,
            value: 15,
        },
        Transition {
            level: 5,
            value: 30,
        },
        Transition {
            level: 7,
            value: 60,
        },
    ],
    level,
);

let monster_chances = &mut [
    Weighted {
        weight: 80,
        item: "orc",
    },
    Weighted {
        weight: troll_chance,
        item: "troll",
    },
];
let monster_choice = WeightedChoice::new(monster_chances);
end::monster_tables[]
----

We define a transition table for the maximum number of monsters and we
modify the chances of the troll showing up.

Now for items a little lower down:

[source]
----
tag::item_tables[]
tag::item_tables_max_items[]
// maximum number of items per room
let max_items = from_dungeon_level(
    &[
        Transition { level: 1, value: 1 },
        Transition { level: 4, value: 2 },
    ],
    level,
);
end::item_tables_max_items[]

tag::item_tables_spells[]
// item random table
let item_chances = &mut [
    // healing potion always shows up, even if all other items have 0 chance
    Weighted {
        weight: 35,
        item: Item::Heal,
    },
    Weighted {
        weight: from_dungeon_level(
            &[Transition {
                level: 4,
                value: 25,
            }],
            level,
        ),
        item: Item::Lightning,
    },
    Weighted {
        weight: from_dungeon_level(
            &[Transition {
                level: 6,
                value: 25,
            }],
            level,
        ),
        item: Item::Fireball,
    },
    Weighted {
        weight: from_dungeon_level(
            &[Transition {
                level: 2,
                value: 10,
            }],
            level,
        ),
        item: Item::Confuse,
    },
end::item_tables_spells[]
tag::item_tables_end[]
];
let item_choice = WeightedChoice::new(item_chances);
end::item_tables_end[]
end::item_tables[]

...

tag::random_item_count[]
// choose random number of items
let num_items = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(0, max_items + 1);
end::random_item_count[]
----

We must also pass `level` to `place_object`.
And since `place_objects` is called from `make_map`, we need to add it there too:

[source]
----
tag::place_objects_header[]
fn place_objects(room: Rect, map: &Map, objects: &mut Vec<Object>, level: u32) {
end::place_objects_header[]
    ...
}

tag::make_map_header[]
fn make_map(objects: &mut Vec<Object>, level: u32) -> Map {
end::make_map_header[]
    ...
tag::call_place_objects[]
    // add some content to this room, such as monsters
    place_objects(new_room, &map, objects, level);
end::call_place_objects[]
    ...
}
----

And we need to pass it to the two places we call `make_map`.
First, where we create the new game:

[source]
----
tag::game_init[]
let mut game = Game {
    // generate map (at this point it's not drawn to the screen)
    map: make_map(&mut objects, 1),  // <1>
    messages: Messages::new(),
    inventory: vec![],
    dungeon_level: 1,
};
end::game_init[]
----
<1> Pass `1` (the first level) to `make_map`

NOTE: We're now using the number `1` for the same thing in two different places:
`map` and `dungeon_level`.
You can pull it out to a variable or a `const` if this bothers you.

And second, when we generate a new map after descending deeper into the dungeon:

[source]
----
include::part-11-dungeon-progression.adoc[tag=next_level_fn_beginning]
    ...
tag::next_level_fn_build_level[]
    game.dungeon_level += 1;
    game.map = make_map(objects, game.dungeon_level);
    initialise_fov(tcod, &game.map);
}
end::next_level_fn_build_level[]
----

You can now remove the `MAX_ROOM_MONSTERS` and `MAX_ROOM_ITEMS`
constants (which the compiler will remind you to do) and change some
of the stats to make the game more balanced:

[source]
----
tag::heal_consts[]
const HEAL_AMOUNT: i32 = 40;  // <1>
end::heal_consts[]
...
tag::fireball_consts[]
const FIREBALL_RADIUS: i32 = 3;
const FIREBALL_DAMAGE: i32 = 25;  // <2>
end::fireball_consts[]
----
<1> Changed from `4` to `40`
<2> Changed from `12` to `25`

And finally, let's update the stats of our monsters and player to reflect the new reality:

[source]
----
// create an orc
tag::generate_orc[]
let mut orc = Object::new(x, y, 'o', "orc", DESATURATED_GREEN, true);
orc.fighter = Some(Fighter {
    max_hp: 20,  // <1>
    hp: 20,  // <2>
    defense: 0,
    power: 4,  // <3>
    xp: 35,
    on_death: DeathCallback::Monster,
});
orc.ai = Some(Ai::Basic);
orc
end::generate_orc[]

// create a troll
tag::generate_troll[]
let mut troll = Object::new(x, y, 'T', "troll", DARKER_GREEN, true);
troll.fighter = Some(Fighter {
    max_hp: 30,  // <4>
    hp: 30,  // <5>
    defense: 2,  // <6>
    power: 8,  // <7>
    xp: 100,
    on_death: DeathCallback::Monster,
});
troll.ai = Some(Ai::Basic);
troll
end::generate_troll[]


// create object representing the player
tag::player_fighter[]
player.fighter = Some(Fighter {
    max_hp: 100,  // <8>
    hp: 100,  // <9>
    defense: 1,  // <10>
    power: 4,  // <11>
    xp: 0,
    on_death: DeathCallback::Player,
});
end::player_fighter[]
----
<1> Change orc's `max_hp` from 10 to 20
<2> Change orc's `hp` from 10 to 20
<3> Change orc's `power` from 3 to 4
<4> Change troll's `max_hp` from 16 to 30
<5> Change troll's `hp` from 16 to 30
<6> Change troll's `defense` from 1 to 2
<7> Change troll's `power` from 4 to 8
<8> Change player's `max_hp` from 30 to 100
<9> Change player's `hp` from 30 to 100
<10> Change player's `defense` from 2 to 1
<11> Change player's `power` from 5 to 4

And that's it. Try playing it for a bit. It will be challenging and
you can't just bash your way through. Try to reach the level 10 or so.
It's pretty fun already despite only having a couple of monsters and a
few items. And it should be fairly straightforward to add more.
